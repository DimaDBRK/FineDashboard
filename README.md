## Description

App offers a streamlined approach to business intelligence, focusing on essential functionalities without the burden of costly licenses. While established BI systems like Tableau, Power BI or Fine BI provide extensive data analytics capabilities, they often come at a significant financial expense.

Many users find that their daily work only requires a handful of reports, typically around 5 to 10 views, along with standard filters and the ability to analyze data in detail using CSV downloads. Fine Dashboard caters to this specific need.

By prioritizing simplicity and efficiency, App empowers users with curated views and straightforward features, ensuring they can access the insights they need without unnecessary complexity.

## Data Identification

World Bank  API has been selected for data collection : https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-api-documentation
The World Bank data consists of demographic and other statistical data related to Population, Employment, GDP, Energy Consumption, etc. for different the countries from the year 1960 to 2022. These categories are called indicators and are each defined by a code.
Example of  indicators:
* SP.POP.TOTL - Total Population
* SP.DYN.CBRT.IN Birth Rate
* SE.COM.DURS - Compulsory Education Duration
* NY.GDP.MKTP.CD - GDP in USD

The following countries have been chosen for data collection:
* US - United States of America
* IN - India
* CN - China
* JP - Japan
* CA - Canada
* GB - Great Britain
* ZA - South Africa

The base API URL is http://api.worldbank.org/v2/ and is followed by the country code and indicator code to obtain the data for each year. No authentication is required to use the API.

### Data Collection & Pre-processing: 
The aforementioned data is meticulously gathered through a loop of async API calls, subsequently subjected to preprocessing and parsing procedures, and stored within a dedicated table. This meticulous process ensures the organization and accessibility of the collected information for efficient utilization.


For live update data used Binance free API:  https://data.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr
A limitation is imposed on the frequency of API requests, allowing for testing at a rate of one request every five seconds.

## Database

ElephantSQL automates every part of setup and running of PostgreSQL clusters.
There are Tables:

fineusers - user unformation

## Frontend

React frontend:
Material UI is employed to design and structure the application's pages.
Dark and Light themes

Data Visualization: 
Nivo (https://nivo.rocks/) and Recharts (https://recharts.org/) charting libraries have been utilized to achieve a refined and sophisticated appearance for the dashboard.

Filtering of data has been implemented both on the server and in the frontend.

The combination of MUI GridDataGrid and GridToolbar facilitates efficient management of server-side pagination and data export to files.


Users have the capability to save preferences and manage their profiles, encompassing actions such as updating their username, deleting their profile, as well as adding and removing reports (views).

Pages and main components.
![Dashboard](dashboard.jpg)
Side bar includes:
* Dashboard - cards of reports
* My reports - dynamically updated list of user reports
* Settings - Reports management (add and remove from My reports list) and Profile
* Developer settings - additional features

Nav bar:
* Button to open and close Side bar
* Dashboard button
* Switch themes button
* User Name and Role info
* Log out and Profile in additional menu

## Authentication

Token-based authentication employs two distinct tokens: the access token, stored in cookies with a short lifespan, and the refresh token, stored in both a dedicated database table and local storage, featuring a prolonged lifespan. A dedicated API facilitates token verification and updates upon the validation of the refresh token. JSON Web Token (JWT) serves as the foundation, utilizing JSON to craft access tokens, thereby enabling the utilization of application or API resources.

Furthermore, the implementation of Protected Routes within React Router ensures that authorized access is maintained.
![Users](users.jpg)
### User Roles and Permissions:
The system delineates between two distinct user roles: User and Developer.
Developers are endowed with specialized access privileges, encompassing features such as Database management on the Developer page, access to a comprehensive users list, and the capability to delete refresh tokens.
On the other hand, users are allocated restricted access, limited solely to the exploration of reports.
This role-based structure ensures a controlled and secure user experience.


## Future Scalability

The application is designed with a modular structure, providing the potential for seamless integration of additional features and data sources in the future.
